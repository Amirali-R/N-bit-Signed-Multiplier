# N_bit_Signed_Multiplier
An optimized n-bit multiplier implemented by Verilog

The multiplier is implemented by two methods : 1.Ordinary Multiplication / 2.Booth-Encoded Multiplication
 
Parameter N (number of bits for multiplication) can be set through the parameter "nb" in the code.

For each of implementations, a test bench code is also included for verification.
